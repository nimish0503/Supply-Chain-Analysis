# Supply-Chain-Analysis

## Overview

This project involves analyzing supply chain data using Python libraries such as pandas and plotly. The main focus areas are:

1. **Data Loading and Basic Analysis:** Import and examine the dataset to understand its structure and basic statistics.
2. **Sales Analysis:** Visualize the relationship between product prices and revenue, and analyze sales distribution by product type.
3. **Shipping Carrier Analysis:** Assess the revenue generated by different shipping carriers and the costs associated with them.
4. **Lead Time and Manufacturing Costs:** Calculate average lead times and manufacturing costs for different product types.
5. **SKU Analysis:** Analyze revenue and order quantities by Stock Keeping Units (SKUs).
6. **Cost Analysis:** Examine shipping costs and distribution of costs by transportation modes.
7. **Defect Rate Analysis:** Evaluate defect rates by product type and transportation mode.

## Conclusion

This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of various aspects of a companyâ€™s supply chain. By examining relationships between product prices and revenue, sales distributions, shipping carriers, costs, and defect rates, the analysis highlights key areas for potential improvements. The insights derived from visualizations help in understanding the effectiveness of different components of the supply chain, enabling better strategic decision-making to enhance overall supply chain performance.
